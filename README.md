# BizChat Multi‑AI Optimization

## What We Solved
This case study examines how we identified and addressed core adoption gaps in the **BizChat AI business-planning platform**. Our goal was to turn sporadic usage into **measurable outcomes** by improving plan completion, content quality, expert involvement, and funding success.

---

## Problems Identified

- **Low Plan Completion (45%)**  
  Users struggled with unclear flows and generic guidance that didn’t adapt to individual goals.

- **Generic, Low-Quality Content (6.2/10)**  
  Content often required rework and led to abandonment because it lacked investment-grade relevance.

- **No Outcome Tracking**  
  The platform could not measure real-world funding impact, leaving improvements unverified.

- **Minimal Expert Involvement & Unstructured Feedback**  
  Lack of structured expert input limited credibility and the ability to iterate effectively.

---

## Solutions Implemented

- **Industry-Specific Multi-AI Orchestration**  
  Deployed 5 vertical-specific AI modules to generate relevant, fundable plan content.

- **Objective Quality Gates**  
  Introduced 1–10 scoring with automated regeneration and improvement suggestions before delivery.

- **Structured Expert Workflow**  
  Implemented expert matching, prep questions, and feedback capture to enhance plan credibility.

- **Outcomes Analytics**  
  Added 3/6/12-month follow-ups to track funding success and continuously improve the platform.
