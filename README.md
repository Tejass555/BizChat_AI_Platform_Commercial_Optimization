# BizChat Multi‑AI Optimization

#  BizChat Multi-AI Optimization (2025)

##  Overview  
This project extends academic research from the **University of Pittsburgh** and **UMBC** on *BizChat* — an AI platform that helps small business owners create business plans.  
While the original research solved **usability challenges**, my analysis focused on **improving content quality, funding outcomes, and commercial success**.

##  Problem  
- Generic, template-driven business plans → low funding success.  
- One-size-fits-all approach → no industry specialization.  
- Usability solved, but **quality & market adoption** were not addressed.

- **Quality Validation** → Developed a scoring system (1–10) + funding outcome tracking.

##  Business Impact  
-  Completion rate: **45% → 75%**  
-  Funding success: **23% → 42%**
